    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),
    [7] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
    It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.
    [8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,
    [9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
